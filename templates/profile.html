        <h5>What Is Jargon?</h5>
        <p>
            Jargon refers to a specialized set of literary terms and language that is used to convey a hidden 
            meaning accepted and understood by those who are part of a particular group, profession, or trade.<br>
            <h5>The Two Types of Jargon-Users</h5><br>  
            Jargon-users are an interesting breed. You’re probably guilty of using jargon when constructing an essay or report just to impress your professor or manager with your exceptional use of words, or perhaps to increase your word count to meet the necessary requirements. Though it’s usually a matter of taste in the kind of vocabulary and sentence structures they use, we can’t deny the fact that some people use jargon to either sound more knowledgeable in a craft, or to make it seem like they’re really a part of something great.

            <h5>Type 1</h5><br>
            The first type of jargonitis (or the excessive use of jargon) are those that use jargon to seem like a proper professional who is serious about their business. They talk in a way that is authoritative, demanding respect from the people around them. This person can converse with a random stranger at the bar, change the natural way they talk by using jargon, and make it seem as if they know exactly what they’re talking about.

Others tend to be bolder and more imaginative compared to most, often creating new buzzwords and phrases to set themselves apart. Though this may seem like a harsh way to describe this category of individuals, there’s not much we can do to help them change their ways. They worry more about using the conventions of language for self-advancement than using it to communicate clearly with an audience. You may also want to know more about adjective clause examples.<br>
            <h5>Type 2</h5><br> 
            Fortunately, people with the second type of jargonitis aren’t as severe as type 1. These are the people who choose to alter their natural fluency in order to adapt to the language of a jargon-user. Oftentimes, the pressure of being able to fit in is what triggers this kind of behavior. Being excluded from a group can take a toll on their self-esteem, forcing them to change a part of themselves just to be acknowledged by avid jargon-users, even when they aren’t completely comfortable with it.Some self-control and a little encouragement from others will certainly restrain you from becoming a type 2 jargonitis. Many teachers and mentors continue to guide their students with the proper use of jargon to prevent any of the two cases mentioned. Keep in mind that it’s only acceptable to use jargon for efficient communication. Otherwise, you might as well avoid the use of jargon completely. You may also see formal writings.
